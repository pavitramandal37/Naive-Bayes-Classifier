# Naive-Bayes-Classifier
Task:
1) Prepare a classification model using the Naive Bayes algorithm for the salary dataset. Train and test datasets are given separately. Use both for model building
2) This dataset contains information of users in a social network. This social network has several business clients which can post ads on it. One of the clients has a car company which has just launched a luxury SUV for a ridiculous price. Build a Bernoulli Naïve Bayes model using this dataset and classify which of the users of the social network are going to purchase this luxury SUV. 1 implies that there was a purchase and 0 implies there wasn’t a purchase.
3) In this case study, you have been given Twitter data collected from an anonymous twitter handle. With the help of a Naïve Bayes model, predict if a given tweet about a real disaster is real or fake.
